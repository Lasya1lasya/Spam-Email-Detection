# Spam-Email-Detection
Spam Email Detection using CountVectorizer & Multinomial Naive Bayes
This project is a binary text classification model that identifies whether an email is spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning. It uses CountVectorizer for feature extraction and Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification.
